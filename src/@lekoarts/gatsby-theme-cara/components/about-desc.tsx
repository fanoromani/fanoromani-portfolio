      You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding
      hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day. My mother cried the day I
      was born because she knew she'd never be prettier than me. You should make
      me your campaign manager. I was born for politics. I have great hair and I
      love lying. Captain? The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is. I
      told them he got sucked up into an airplane engine, is that all right?
