You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day.
My mother cried the day I was born because she knew sheâ€™d never be prettier than me. You should make me your campaign
manager. I was born for politics. I have great hair and I love lying. Captain? The kids want to know where
Paulie the Pigeon is. I told them he got sucked up into an airplane engine, is that all right?
